### My all-time favorite quote about computer programming:
#### *“Don’t comment bad code — rewrite it.” ~ Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plaugher.*
> If only the developers I have worked with believed in this.
### I like solving complex problems, so some people call me a nerd <br>
#### but I don't take that stuff personally.

> Do I look like a nerd?  Idk.. I hide it well.
### I love programming and have used (in alpha order): <br>
#### C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python and (cough) VB
##### <i>I refuse to do another Hello World program. <br>
##### My code says, "Hello, Universe!"</i>

```#Python code
    # Some very simple Python Code
    # Declare a string
    sentence = "Nikola Tesla, where are you?"
    first_string=f"Hello Universe! {sentence}"
    print(first_string)
    print(first_string.capitalize())
    print(first_string.lower())
    print(first_string.upper())
    print("There are " + str(first_string.count('l')) + " 'l's.")
    print(first_string.find('ni'))
    print(first_string.find('Ni'))
    print(first_string.find('NI'))
    
    #split function
    print(first_string.split())
    len(first_string)
    
    #type function
    print(type("Hello Universe"))
    print(type(3.14))
    print(type(12))
    
    #isinstance function
    print(isinstance(3, int))
    print(isinstance("Nikola", str))
    print(isinstance(3, str))
    
    #casting
    num=43.6
    print(int(num))
    print(str(num))
    print(round(num))
    print(float(num))

### My favorite tools on my computer are Git Bash and VS Code

> It's getting better.
### I’m interested in Edge Computing

### I’m currently learning Go
